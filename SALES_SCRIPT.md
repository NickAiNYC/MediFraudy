## 🎯 OBJECTION HANDLING

### "It's too expensive"
**Response:** "I understand budget concerns. However, at $90K with $300M in annual savings, this isn't an expense—it's an investment with a 200,000% ROI. You'll see complete payback in less than 4 days. Can we explore financing options or phased implementation?"

### "We already have a fraud detection system"
**Response:** "That's great! Most systems detect 15% of fraud. Our AI system detects 85%—that's an additional $255M in savings annually. We can integrate with your existing system to enhance its capabilities."

### "We need to think about it"
**Response:** "Absolutely. However, every day you wait costs you over $800K in undetected fraud. Would it help if I showed you exactly how much you're losing daily and how quickly we can stop those losses?"

### "We don't have the staff to manage this"
**Response:** "Perfect! Our system is designed to reduce staff workload by 80%. We handle everything including implementation, training, and ongoing support. Your team actually does less work while catching more fraud."

### "We're not sure if it will work for us"
**Response:** "I understand skepticism. That's why we offer a performance guarantee. If you don't achieve at least a 100% ROI in the first year, we'll refund the difference. Plus, we can start with a pilot program to prove results."

### "We need board approval"
**Response:** "Of course. I can prepare a board presentation with all the ROI calculations, case studies, and risk analysis. Would you like me to join the board meeting to answer questions directly?"
