## 🎯 HANDLING REJECTION

### Common Objections & Responses

**"We're not interested"**
"I understand. Most organizations don't realize they're losing $300M annually. Would you be open to a 10-minute call to understand the actual cost of fraud in your organization?"

**"We already have a system"**
"That's great! Most systems detect 15% of fraud. Our AI system detects 85%. That's an additional $255M in savings annually. We can enhance your existing system."

**"It's too expensive"**
"I understand budget concerns. At $90K with $300M in savings, this pays for itself in 3.6 days. We also offer financing options. What would make this work for your budget?"

**"Send me information"**
"Absolutely! I'll send our proposal showing how we achieve a 200,000% ROI. What specific aspect would you like me to focus on in the email?"

**"We need to think about it"**
"Of course. However, every day you wait costs over $800K in undetected fraud. Would it help if I showed you exactly how much you're losing daily while you decide?"
